# Crunch-Scrapper
This is a simple `NodeJS` script that fetches data from crunchbase website and stores them in a database.

## Libraries used

### Express

This is the Javascript framework that I have used to create this Nodejs Application. More can be found [here](https://expressjs.com/)

### Cheerio

This is a web-scrapping library that is extensively used and has a huge community supporting its development.

While I had the option of using `Puppeteer`, I chose to use this library provided for Nodejs keeping in mind the sanity of the code.

### SQLite
This is a SQL based database that I used to store the data.

## How to use this

Clone this repository and run 
>npm install

And to run the program -
>npm run start

And open `localhost:3001` on a browser.
